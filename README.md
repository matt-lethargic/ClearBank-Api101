# ClearBankÂ® API 101

This repository is intended for users who are testing their connectivity and interaction with the ClearBank API and webhooks.

It contains an example Golang application that demonstrates how to make a call to the ClearBank API and how to receive, validate and respond to webhooks.

Please note that the code in this repository is not production ready and has been simplified for brevity.

## Overview

The application has one controller with 2 endpoints:

- `POST /sample/api` to make an API request to the `POST /v1/test` endpoint in the ClearBank API
- `POST /sample/webhook` to receive webhooks from ClearBank

It does payload signing for API calls and signature verification for webhooks

### Prerequisites

To be able to run the application and receive webhooks, you will need:

- [Golang Binaries](https://golang.org/dl/)
- [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) We have used version 2.3.35

## Set up on the ClearBank Portal

You will need:

- Your private key and a Certificate Signing Request (CSR) created in PKCS #10 format
- An API token, which can be generated by uploading your CSR file on the **`Certificates and Tokens`** page of the ClearBank Portal
- Your public key which can be downloaded from the **`Webhook Management`** page of the ClearBank Portal

Copy your public key to GoClearBank.pub, your API token will need to be added to `main.go`

```
authProfile = AuthProfile{
		Token:          "<token-here>",
```

## Build and run

```cmd
go run .
```

Application starts listening on port 8000.
You can also test it:

```cmd
curl.exe --location --request POST "http://localhost:9000/sample/api" --header "Content-Type: application/json" --data-raw "{\"fieldName\" :\"test\"}"
```

Now set up ngrok

```cmd
.\ngrok.exe http 8000
```

You will get an output similar to

```cmd
Forwarding https://91bf871fa2aa.ngrok.io -> http://localhost:8000 
```

Copy the url and add `/webhook` at the end.
